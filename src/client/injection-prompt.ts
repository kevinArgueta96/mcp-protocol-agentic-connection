/**
 * Build the prompt that the bridge daemon injects as a fresh turn into the
 * Codex CLI when a channel message arrives from another agent.
 *
 * Design goals (prompt engineering):
 *
 * 1. **Clarity over brevity.** The receiving LLM has zero prior context about
 *    the channel system, the sender, or what it is supposed to do. The prompt
 *    must explain itself in one read.
 *
 * 2. **Visual separation between data and instructions.** The actual message
 *    content is wrapped in `----- BEGIN/END MESSAGE -----` markers so the LLM
 *    cannot confuse "what the sender wrote" with "how the bridge wants me to
 *    respond". This guards against prompt-injection attempts inside the
 *    message body too — the BEGIN/END frame makes it obvious that everything
 *    inside is untrusted user input from another agent.
 *
 * 3. **Pre-filled tool call.** The receiver should not have to derive
 *    `agentId`, `conversationId` or `replyTo` from prose. The exact `reply`
 *    invocation is rendered with all values literally expanded so the LLM can
 *    copy them verbatim. This eliminated a common failure where Codex
 *    would try to substitute the bridge agentId for the inner-client agentId
 *    (which the adapter already handles via auto-redirect).
 *
 * 4. **Discriminate `expectsResponse`.** A reply-expected message gets the
 *    full call template; a fire-and-forget message gets an explicit "do NOT
 *    call reply" line, with a hint to use `message_client_session` if a
 *    follow-up thread makes sense.
 *
 * 5. **Sender identity surfaced up front.** The sender's display name and the
 *    last 8 chars of their agentId (the unique hash) appear in the header so
 *    the LLM can address them naturally ("As you asked, …").
 *
 * The function is pure: same input → same output. It has no I/O, so it is
 * trivially unit-testable. The Codex bridge daemon (`codex-app-server-bridge.ts`)
 * imports this single implementation.
