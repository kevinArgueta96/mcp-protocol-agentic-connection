name: open-agent-bridge
description: Use when sending or replying to channel messages between agents (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini). Activate when: list_agents, message_client_session, channel_inbox, or reply MCP tools are needed; when a <channel> push arrives; when deliveryState shows delivered_to_bridge stuck; when routing to Codex/Gemini inner vs bridge peers; when authoring code that uses the agent-bridge MCP tools or ChannelMessage protocol; when setting up the registry, MCP config, or bridge daemons.

# open-agent-bridge

Local communication hub for AI agents. Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and Gemini CLI exchange messages through a central registry over MCP tools and WebSocket channels.

## When to use

- You received a `<channel>` push and need to reply
- You want to send a task or message to another agent
- `list_agents` / `message_client_session` / `channel_inbox` / `reply` are needed
- Delivery is stuck at `delivered_to_bridge` and you need to diagnose why
- You need to set up a new agent, configure MCP, or start a bridge daemon

## Quick reference — 5 MCP tools

| Tool | Use for |
|---|---|
| `agent_bridge_guide` | Read the protocol guide (topics: overview, setup, send, reply, acks, troubleshooting) |
| `list_agents` | Discover connected agents and client sessions |
| `message_client_session` | Send a message to a peer; starts or continues a thread |
| `channel_inbox` | Inspect pending conversations awaiting reply |
| `reply` | Respond to a pending message; closes the thread |

## Send workflow

```
1. list_agents(includeClients: true)
   → find the target agentId or project name

2. message_client_session(
     message: "...",
     clientId: "<agentId>",   // or project: "<name>"
     expectsResponse: true     // omit to let the adapter infer
   )
   → returns conversationId, messageId, deliveryState

3. Wait for reply via <channel> push or poll channel_inbox
```

## Reply workflow

```
1. channel_inbox(pendingOnly: true)
   → each entry has a replyWith block

2. reply(
     agentId:        replyWith.agentId,        // copy verbatim
     conversationId: replyWith.conversationId, // copy verbatim
     replyTo:        replyWith.replyTo,        // copy verbatim
     message:        "..."
   )
```

Never open a new thread to respond to a pending message — always use `reply` with the existing `conversationId`.

## Routing rules

The adapter resolves the best target automatically:

1. `clientId` provided → direct lookup, no resolution
2. Only `conversationId` provided → resolved from conversation history
3. `project` provided → filter by project path/name
4. Multiple matches → bridge daemons win (priority -1), then: claude-code > opencode > gemini > codex

Codex inner MCP clients (`client-codex-mcp-client-*`) and Gemini inner clients are auto-redirected to their bridge daemon. Never substitute `replyWith.agentId` manually — the adapter handles re-routing.

## ACK states

```
queued
  → delivered_to_bridge   (bridge received the message)
    → displayed_to_client (client session received it)
      → answered          (reply was sent)
      → failed            (delivery or reply failed)
```

If `delivered_to_bridge` does not advance: the bridge is running but the client session is not attached. See `references/troubleshooting.md`.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not open a new thread to reply to a pending message — use `reply`
- Do not substitute `replyWith.agentId` with another ID — adapter handles routing
- Do not set `requiresAck: true` on fire-and-forget messages
- Do not call `message_client_session` to reply — that starts a new thread
